# Yuval_non_linear_v1

This package is first of all - a FORK of the known BLOCKCHAIN code published for working with blockchain.com API.
Please reffer to the folder "YUVAL" for personal add-ons ( after giving up with the API - as I explain below ).
Important note:
The API is fantastic, although it was built to NOT give more than the last 50 transactions per the Address you specify.
for experimental purposes, it's fine. ( and incredibly slow ).
for deep reserach of the blockchain, this isn't good enough by any means.
On top of that, blockchain.com did not design an upgraded payable API. just not.

so what's in my package?
a lot of functions meant for sorting out information.
a few objects.
lists of objects.
ditched pickled files for temporary saves and reload.
a .py file that reads straight from Bitcoin Core and interacts with its RPC. (works well but transactions are still coded and not fully readable).

in other words - non production. only author matterials running arround.
